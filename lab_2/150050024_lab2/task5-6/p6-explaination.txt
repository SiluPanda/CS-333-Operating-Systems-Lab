I printed the required message for both parent and child and made parent process sleep for 60s.
Then child process waits for a integer user input. Meanwhile in a terminal I ran the ps -o pid,stat −−pid <child’s PID> command
to check the status of the command.

The status were of two kinds,

1. PID STATS
	3020 S+

2. PID STATS
	3020 Z+


where,

 S : Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
 Z : Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its
            parent.

 + : is in the foreground process group
